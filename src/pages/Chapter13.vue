          Cut to the skating rink. Night. The skating rink is fully decorated.
          The Christmas lights shine through the cold night.
          <br /><br />
          Later that night, the whole town congregates at the skating rink to
          watch the nativity. But there’s a little less magic with Catie gone
          (the whole town misses her). There’s an area on the ice designated as
          the stage, although it’s not elevated. In front of it, rows of chairs
          have been set up for the town to sit in. A curtain has been hung
          across some rope to hide the scenery from the audience. Off to the
          side of the congregation is a brass band setting up to provide music
          for the night. We see Cassandra blowing air through her trumpet.
          <br /><br />
          Beryl and Erin sit in the audience and wait for the show to start, but
          there’s clearly some delay. The show isn’t starting. Madi approaches
          Erin and Beryl. She explains that they’re having problems convincing
          the Christmas Angel (Sarah) to go on with the show. Erin starts to get
          up to walk with Madi backstage to talk to Sarah. Beryl also starts to
          get up. “I’ve got this.” He motions for Erin to set back down. “Let me
          talk to her.” Erin gives him the go-ahead.
          <br /><br />
          Beryl and Madi walk backstage and find Sarah with a tear-streaked face
          and red eyes. She’s still wiping tears away with the back of her hand.
          Her lips are quivering. Sarah can barely go on, she’s almost sobbing
          with Catie gone. Beryl kneels down to be at her level. “What’s wrong,
          Angel?” He asks.
          <br /><br />
          “I miss Catie. I want her to come and see me be the angel and tell
          everyone about the baby Jesus!”
          <br /><br />
          “There were some things I wanted her to hear me say, too.” Beryl says.
          He hugs Sarah. Sarah sobs on Beryl’s shoulders. Beryl acknowledges
          that Catie was pretty great, and that the whole town misses her. But
          he explains there’s nothing they can really do about that right now.
          He says that it’s going to be Christmas soon, and Sarah needs to do
          her part. “I bet, wherever Catie is right now, she’ll be thinking
          about you when you tell everyone about the baby Jesus.” He’s trying to
          convince himself that she’ll be thinking about him, as he knows he’ll
          be thinking about her.
          <br /><br />
          “I loved her, Uncle Beryl!” Sarah sobs.
          <br /><br />
          Beryl chuckles, “Oh, Angel. That makes two of us.” Beryl pulls Sarah
          into his arms and gives her a big hug. He realizes that he should have
          told Catie how he felt.
          <br /><br />
          Sarah sobs on Beryl’s shoulders while they’re still hugging. Beryl
          talks Sarah into “doing it for Catie.” He wipes away her tears. Sarah
          has a smile on her face. “So whaddya say, Angel? Think you can get out
          there and be the best angel Christmas has ever seen?” Sarah nods,
          wiping away tears.
          <br /><br />
          Beryl sends Sarah on her way and walks back to his seat next to Erin.
          Erin looks at Beryl with a look that says “Well? Is everything okay?”
          Beryl nods and winks at Erin and gives the thumbs up. “Sarah’s going
          to be fine.” He starts to sit down
          <br /><br />
          “Are you?” questions Erin with raised eyebrows.
          <br /><br />
          Before he can sit down, Beryl thinks for a minute and says, “There’s
          something I gotta go do. Save my seat?” Erin nods with a big smile.
          Beryl squeezes between the seats in the next row and people’s legs in
          his row. “Excuse me. Sorry folks. Pardon me. Glad you all could make
          it. Sorry about this.” Finally he makes it out of the row and briskly
          walks to the skating rink’s exit. He almost runs into Kelly and
          Lauren. They’re no longer dressed in their coveralls. They’ve put on
          nice clothes for the show.
          <br /><br />
          “Oh good,” says Beryl with relief. “Is Catie still at the garage?”
          <br /><br />
          “No,” says Kelly with a confused look on his face. Then a thought
          comes to him. “But, they did mention that they still need to pack a
          few things at the Bed and Breakfast.” Before Kelly can finish, Beryl
          sprints down Main Street toward the Bed and Breakfast.
          <br /><br />
          The rink lights go low except for two spotlights that show Madi taking
          center stage. Madi thanks all those who helped. She says something
          funny and the crowd chuckles. She introduces the show. The curtains
          are pulled back revealing a beautifully decorated skating rink that
          now more closely resembles an ancient Bethlehem and countryside with
          ice instead of dirt for ground. Scattered “Ooh” and “Ahhh” emanate
          from the crowd.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cut back to Beryl running down mainstreet. Buildings and Christmas
          lights speeding past in a blur.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Cut back to the Nativity. We see the audience’s point of view. On the
          makeshift “stage” on the ice we see a young boy and girl playing
          Joseph and Mary. We hear the narrator say, “And Joseph also went up
          from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judæa, unto the city
          of David, which is called Bethlehem.” The boy and girl skate through
          the Bethlehem scenery.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Cut to the Bed and Breakfast. Beryl runs up to the front door and
          opens it. The lights inside are still on. He bursts through the
          doorway shouting, “Catie! Catie!” He’s got a big smile on his face. He
          can’t wait to see her again and tell her how he feels. But the main
          floor is completely deserted. He runs through the dining room, the
          sitting room. “Catie!” Nothing.
          <br /><br />
          He sees the lights on upstairs. He races up the stairs two at a time.
          “Catie!” He runs into Catie’s and Blaze’s room. “Catie.” He shouts the
          first syllable, but not the second, as he runs into the room. He comes
          to sudden halt. The room is empty. The beds are neatly made. The
          closets are empty. There’s no sign of them anywhere. All that’s left
          is Catie’s blue scarf on the bed. He sits on the bed and holds the
          scarf in defeat.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Cut back to the Nativity on Ice. We see from above, Mary wrapping a
          baby in swaddling clothes and placing him in a manger while Joseph and
          fake animals look on. The brass band starts to play “Silent Night.”
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Cut to Erin’s point of view. Beryl’s empty seat is next to her.
          Offscreen we hear Beryl approaching, again squeezing between the other
          patrons’ legs. He gets to his seat and sits down.
          <br /><br />
          “How’s it coming?” Beryl asks.
          <br /><br />
          “Good, you’re just in time for the Angel.”
          <br /><br />
          We see a myriad of grown ups and children in ornate bath robes with
          shepherd crooks skating around the Bethlehem countryside. They’re
          skating around fake sheep standing on the ice.
          <br /><br />
          The narrator explains, “And there were in the same country shepherds
          abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And,
          lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord
          shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.”
          <br /><br />
          Sarah skates in circles around the shepherds and their flocks. Raising
          her hands, she says, stumbling over her hard-to-remember lines, “Fear
          not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall
          be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a
          Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.”
          <br /><br />
          She stops skating in circles and goes to the front of the shepherds.
          “And this shall be a sign unto you;” she pauses, trying to remember
          what comes next. The whole town is watching and she’s very nervous.
          “Ye shall find...Ye shall find…” She bites her lip. The audience is
          starting to fidget in nervousness on her behalf. Sarah tries again.
          “And this shall be a sign unto you; ye shall find...ye shall find…”
          She pauses, trying to remember. The silence hangs heavy in the air.
          Sarah looks nervously to the audience.
          <br /><br />
          She tries again. “Ye shall find…” Her eyes get really big. A smile
          stretches across her face as she sees someone in the very back of the
          audience. “Ye shall find CATIE!”
          <br /><br />
          The whole audience/town gasps. They look to see Catie walking into the
          rink. Even the spotlights swirl around to shine on Catie in the back
          of the rink. She shields her eyes from the bright spotlights. The town
          begins to chatter with excitement at Catie’s return. Catie is a little
          embarrassed at all the attention. The audience stands up in their
          chairs and begin to walk toward her. The first ones to greet her are
          Emma, Brock, Chella, Dallan, Esther, Derek, Trent, Jenn. They take
          turns giving her a hug. Even Beryl and Erin move toward Catie, but
          Beryl hangs back, cautious to get too excited. Catie, however, walks
          straight toward Beryl. The crowd starts to part. They know where she’s
          headed. But Sarah intercepts, almost knocking Catie over. She gives
          Catie’s waist the biggest hug. “Catie!” Sarah squeals. Catie chuckles
          then lifts up Sarah into her arms.
          <br /><br />
          Erin comes to get Sarah off Catie. “Come here my little angel.”
          <br /><br />
          Catie hands Sarah over and gives Erin a sisterly hug. There’s still a
          low hum of people chattering over the return of Catie.
          <br /><br />
          Catie briskly walks up to Beryl. She stops in front of him like she
          has before. But this time she surprises him by wrapping her arms
          around him. Beryl is a little taken aback, but happy. They embrace.
          The whole town forms an impromptu circle around the two.
          <br /><br />
          “What made you come back?” Asks Beryl, still holding her tight, but
          looking intently into her eyes.
          <br /><br />
          She looks around at the crowd. She eyes Trent, who has a big smile on
          his face. She says, “I decided it was finally time to follow my
          heartpeanut.” Trent’s smile gets bigger and he squeezes Jenn closer.
          “I just couldn’t imagine Christmas anywhere else. With anyone else.”
          The crowd cheers and congratulates each other. The married couples
          hold each other close, some kiss. Children dressed in homemade ancient
          Hebrew costumes join their families.

          Not far in the distance the clock tower strikes twelve, heralding in
          the Holiday of Holidays. Snow begins to fall from the sky as if
          signaled by the bells. The crowd begins to exclaim “Oh,” in
          excitement. The band begins to play Hark the Herald Angels Sing at a
          quick tempo (not slow like it’s always played in church). The crowd
          cheers. Couples and families embrace one another and begin singing
          along at the top of their lungs. It’s Christmas!
          <br /><br />
          Beryl and Catie stare into each other’s eyes, each with a big grin and
          snow flakes in their hair and on their face. They kiss. The crowd sees
          this and cheers even wilder. It resembles New Year’s Eve more than
          Christmas morning. They break the kiss. Catie asks, with a smile
          (knowing the answer), “What are you so happy about?”
          <br /><br />
          To which Beryl responds, “It just feels like...It feels like Christmas
          morning.”
          <br /><br />
          Catie chuckles. “It is Christmas morning, silly.”
          <br /><br />
          Beryl smiles big. “Oh I know. I know. It is Christmas morning.”
          <br /><br />
