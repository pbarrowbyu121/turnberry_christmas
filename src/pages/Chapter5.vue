        Cut a few hours ahead. An exterior shot of Rachael’s Bed and Breakfast.
        It’s dark out. Blaze is on the bed flipping through channels on the TV.
        Catie comes out of the bathroom in a different pair of pants. Catie
        suggests they go skating at the quaint skating rink. Blaze doesn’t want
        to. “I dunno, babe. Don’t you think it’s been kind of a long day
        already? Wouldn’t you rather just cuddle up and watch The Office?” Catie
        just sighs out of exasperation and walks out the room leaving Blaze
        alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Catie walks across the street to the skating rink. She hears Christmas
        carols playing in the distance softly and the cacophony of people having
        a good time somewhere. The Christmas lights on Main Street are
        beautiful. She can hear chatter and merry laughter coming from the rink.
        She stands by the rink and watches for a bit. A familiar voice behind
        her (unseen) says, “You know, it’s even more fun if you actually skate.”
      </p>
      <p>
        She turns around to see Beryl kneeling, tying the skates on the feet of
        a cute little girl sitting on a chair in front of Beryl. She’s maybe
        7-10. She’s in pigtails, wearing a pink coat. Beryl stands up, puts his
        hands on his hips. “You’re all set!” he says.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Thanks, Uncle Beryl!” says the little girl in a high-pitched, excited
        voice with a big smile. She brushes past Catie and walks to the rink
        awkwardly in her skates and starts skating. Once she’s on the ice, she’s
        far from awkward.
      </p>
      <p>
        “They do have skating where you’re from, don’t they?” asks Beryl,
        condescendingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Catie doesn’t dignify his question with a response. The question puts
        her in a bit of a sour mood. Maybe Blaze was right. Maybe she should
        have stayed in and not ventured out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Catie and Beryl both lean against the rink railing made of rough-hewn
        timber in silence and watch young Sarah skate. Beryl tries to break the
        ice and says, “I couldn’t help but notice your necklace back at the
        garage.” He waits for her to respond. She doesn’t. “It’s a turtle dove,
        right?” She’s being a little stand-off-ish.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Congratulations,” she says sarcastically. “You know your holiday fowl.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Catie realizes how unpleasant she’s being. “I’m sorry,” she concedes.
        She rubs the lone turtle dove in her hand. “It was a gift from my...from
        someone special.” She stares off into the distance, thinking about a
        painful memory. It’s clear she doesn’t really want to talk about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It’s just the one turtle dove though,” Beryl says. “Turtle doves always
        fly in pairs. They never go anywhere without either their spouse or
        their offspring. They’re very protective of the ones they love.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Catie embarrassingly hides it by putting it under her shirt. “Great, so
        you know your Christmas songs. Nice job for not sleeping through 30
        Christmases.” She catches herself for being rude. She puts her hands up
        as if to stop herself. “I’m sorry. Again. It’s just been a long day.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “So, what brings you to Turnberry?” asks Beryl, changing the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        Catie doesn’t answer right away. Catie and Beryl are watching Sarah and
        the other skaters as they lean against the wooden fence surrounding the
        ice rink. Sarah waves at Beryl and Catie whenever she passes. “I’m
        asking myself that same thing,” Catie replies finally. She changes the
        subject. “So you’re her uncle?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Not exactly. I mean, she calls me that, but I’m not actually her
        uncle.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Well, ‘Uncle Beryl,’ I like what you’ve done with the place. It looks
        like a Norman Rockwell painting,” compliments Catie.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Thanks, but I actually can’t take any of the credit. Sarah’s mom runs
        the place.”
      </p>
      <p>
        They both stand against the wooden railing in silence for a bit more.
        The ease at which Beryl puts her also makes her a bit anxious. They
        smile at the skaters, especially Sarah. Catie sighs as if she isn’t
        allowing herself to fully enjoy the moment. Then out of nowhere, she
        says, “Have you ever felt like you were living someone else’s life?”
        Beryl gets kind of a confused look on his face. She continues. “Or at
        least someone else was living your life somewhere else? The life you
        were supposed to be living, I mean. Like maybe somehow there was a
        mix-up along the way.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Beryl thinks for a minute. “For about a week I kept getting someone
        else’s mail at my apartment. I went to throw it out and ran into another
        person throwing out MY mail. Turns out it was HIS mail that I was
        getting the whole time.” He sorta chuckles. “But that’s probably not
        what you mean, is it.” They both laugh quietly.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a moment of just watching the skaters in silence, Beryl speaks.
        “Sometimes...I dunno.” Beryl looks for the right words to say. “I used
        to think if you did ‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘C’ then ‘X’, ‘Y’, and ‘Z’ would
        happen.” He looks over at Erin in the skate shack, sharpening skates and
        assisting customers. “Even if not for you, you hope that’s the way it
        works for your friends.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Sarah skates over to Beryl. “Come on in, Beryl! The water’s fine!” she
        exclaims, waving her arm toward the rink.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It looks a little frozen to me, Sarah,” jokes Beryl. Beryl starts to
        get up from leaning against the fence and heads toward the shack. Just
        as he does so, Sarah looks intently at Catie. Studying her face.
      </p>
      <p>
        “You look like an angel,” Sarah says to Catie. Catie sort of blushes and
        looks down. “Are you Samantha?” Sarah asks Catie, innocently.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beryl’s eyes go wide and he quickly turns back around. He sort of
        stumbles over words, trying to say something to avoid embarrassment.
        Catie looks a little confused, but politely responds, “No. My name is
        Catie. What’s your name?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Sarah doesn’t answer her question, but continues. “Oh, I thought you
        were Samantha because you’re so pretty. Beryl said Sam was really
        pretty.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Oh, really?” smiles Catie. She looks over at Beryl, detecting his
        embarrassment. He bows his head to avoid the awkwardness and scratches
        the back of his head. He walks onto the ice, stands behind Sarah, and
        puts his hands on her shoulders. Catie inquires, “And who might Samantha
        be?” The question is directed to Sarah but Catie is looking at Beryl.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sarah responds excitedly, “Oh, she’s Beryl’s grmrfrmr.” Sarah’s last
        words are muffled as Beryl quickly covers Sarah’s mouth with his hand.
        He finishes her sentence for her.
      </p>
      <p>
        “She was a co-worker of mine. Back in New York.” He kind of glares at
        Sarah. “Sarah, why don’t you go skate with your friends.” Sarah kind of
        rolls her eyes, but skates back to join the other girls on the ice.
        Beryl looks back at Catie who has a smile on her face at Beryl’s
        expense.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beryl looks invitingly at Catie. “Whaddya say, Catie? Shall we? I just
        sharpened a pair of eights in the skate shed.”
      </p>
      <p>Catie is surprised, “How did you know my size?”</p>
      <p>Beryl shrugs, “It’s a gift.”</p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Cut to Beryl and Catie stepping onto the ice in their skates. Catie
        holds her hands out to keep her balance as she tries to find sure
        footing. Beryl faces her. “Now, the secret to ice skating is all in your
        knees. Keep ‘em bent. There you go. And move your toes to the outside.”
        Other skaters are zooming past Catie and Beryl. Catie is catching on
        rather quickly, though. “There you go!” says Beryl, encouragingly. “Have
        you done this before?” asks Beryl in a surprised tone. Catie is no
        expert, but she’s more comfortable than the typical novice.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yes, but it’s been a long time. When I was a kid I used to go all the
        time with my…” She abruptly stops her sentence. “It’s just been a really
        long time.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Beryl continues to skate backwards, facing Catie as she remembers what
        was once second nature. Beryl does a 180, faces front, and skates
        alongside her. “Ahh,” he sighs in relief. “NOW it’s starting to feel
        like Christmas.” Their hands brush each other’s a few times.
      </p>
      <p>
        They’re both looking intently at the ice, navigating the rink carefully.
        Catie almost slips.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Whoah! I’ve got you,” Beryl says as he catches her on the arm. His hand
        slides down and they hold hands for “safety” and “balance.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Sarah zooms past a little too close to Beryl and Catie causing Catie to
        slip, right into Beryls arms. They both collapse to the ice. Catie ends
        up on top of Beryl. Their lips come romantically close to each other’s.
        They freeze, lips just inches from each other. Their eyes alternate
        glancing at the other’s lips and eyes. It only lasts a few seconds, but
        it seems like minutes. Erin is watching all of this from inside the
        skate shack, smiling while she’s polishing blades.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then Beryl or Catie breaks the moment and both get back on their feet,
        brush themselves off. But Catie drops her bright blue scarf onto the
        ice. She’s in such a hurry she doesn’t notice. Both are apologizing
        profusely. Catie says it’s getting late and she better get back to the
        bed and breakfast to get ready for the dinner that night. She hurriedly
        walks out of the rink and sits on a nearby bench. She unties her skates
        in record time and replaces them with her boots.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beryl is still brushing himself off on the ice but can’t keep his eyes
        off her, so much so that he can’t get his balance and get up easily.
        “Wait,” he tries to beckon. “Catie!” He notices her scarf on the ice. He
        picks it up and runs after her. He waves the scarf above his head.
        “Wait! Your scarf!” he calls. But it’s too late. She’s already too far
        away and he’s still in his skates walking around awkwardly. He drops his
        arm back to his side.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Catie crosses the street back to the bed and breakfast, she turns
        around and stares longingly back to the skating rink. After a few
        seconds, she snaps back to reality and walks the last few yards to the
        front door of Rachael’s.
