          Next shot we see Beryl driving Erin’s truck (“Carson”) through Main
          Street in the morning. The sun is up. A small number of people are
          walking around downtown starting on their day. The truck is still
          warming up. Through the windshield we see Catie waiting outside the
          Bed and Breakfast. She’s bundled up and has her arm extended, ending
          in a fist with the thumb raised. She sees Beryl’s truck coming down
          the road. Beryl has a confused look as he recognizes her. “What in the
          world…” He slows the truck to a stop in front of Catie. He reaches
          across the passenger seat to manually roll the window down.
          <br /><br />
          “Hey,” says Catie, raising her mouth from beneath her scarf just long
          enough to not freeze. “Thought you could use some help.”
          <br /><br />
          Beryl still isn’t sure what to think about all this but lets her in,
          puts the truck into gear, and drives away. They’re silent for some
          time . Beryl keeps his eyes on the road. Catie wants to say something.
          “So, where we headed?”
          <br /><br />
          Beryl looks at her with a glare, then back to the road. He’s got one
          hand on the steering wheel. After an uncomfortable amount of time he
          states, “I’m getting some hay. For the Nativity.”
          <br /><br />
          His curtness stings Catie a little. She tries again. “I know that. But
          where are we going to get that hay?”
          <br /><br />
          Beryl is clearly not in a very good mood. “Trent and Jenn’s farm.”
          <br /><br />
          After a few minutes of more silence, Catie ventures, “Listen, Beryl. I
          said some things yesterday that were uncalled for.”
          <br /><br />
          Beryl doesn’t respond. He keeps his eyes on the road. It’s almost as
          if he doesn’t hear Catie.
          <br /><br />
          Catie continues. “It’s just been a stressful couple of months.
          Maybe...sigh...I dunno. Maybe I was upset because some of the things
          you said might be true.”
          <br /><br />
          This gets Beryl’s attention. He takes a quick glance at Catie with a
          small nod showing he’s listening. But he doesn’t say anything.
          <br /><br />
          Catie tries to force a conversation, but Beryl gives one word answers.
          “So, what was New York like?”
          <br /><br />
          Beryl doesn’t answer but returns with a question. “You ever been?”
          <br /><br />
          “Yes. Ohh yes. That’s actually where Blaze and I...er, that’s actually
          where I’m from.”
          <br /><br />
          “Really? No way! What part?” Beryl has a renewed interest in the
          conversation.
          <br /><br />
          “Well sort of. Upper West Side.”
          <br /><br />
          “Upper West Side?! That’s where I lived too!”
          <br /><br />
          Catie gets a big smile on her face. “Did you ever eat at Cochino’s
          Deli?”
          <br /><br />
          “On 85th and Amsterdam? Yeah! I loved Cochino’s!”
          <br /><br />
          “So why did you leave New York?” pries Catie.
          <br /><br />
          They’re pretty excited at this common background. Then Beryl gets a
          serious look on his face. “To be honest, I loved New York, but once my
          friends had left, it suddenly felt too big. Big but empty.”
          <br /><br />
          Catie tilts her head. “What do you mean, empty?”
          <br /><br />
          Beryl gets a little sentimental. His eyes are on the road, but it also
          seems like he’s staring back into time. “I met Erin and Peter in
          college. We had all just moved into the Elms apartments and we each
          ended up in the laundromat on that first night at the same time. Just
          the three of us. Peter suggested we go eat at the pizzeria next door
          while we wait for our laundry. Next week, same thing. Next week, same
          thing. Pretty soon we spend all our time outside of class together.
          That first night we were strangers but it felt more like old friends
          who just met.”
          <br /><br />
          Catie starts to fill in blanks herself. “Then Peter and Erin started
          dating?”
          <br /><br />
          “Yep. I dated a few girls, too. But nothing came close to what they
          had. Peter proposed to Erin that first Christmas after we all met.
          “After college, we moved to New York. Peter and I worked at the same
          firm. Erin was helping with a non-profit. Things were going great.
          “When Erin got pregnant, they decided to put New York in their
          rearview mirror and moved here. I decided to stay in Manhattan, but
          I’d spend Christmas here.”
          <br /><br />
          “What happened to Peter?”
          <br /><br />
          “He died the December after Sarah was born. I’d still visit Turnberry
          each Christmas, try to help Erin out.”
          <br /><br />
          “Wow. They sound like great friends.”
          <br /><br />
          “The best. The holidays are especially difficult for Erin with Peter
          gone.”
          <br /><br />
          “Is that why you decided to move out here?”
          <br /><br />
          “I guess. The dating scene in New York was … complex. People have
          different priorities. I just couldn’t find someone that had the same
          magic Peter and Erin had. You know that feeling you got as a child on
          Christmas morning? So excited you couldn’t help but smile?” Beryl asks
          with a grin.
          <br /><br />
          Catie nods in agreement with a smile on her face.
          <br /><br />
          “Peter and Erin were like that all the time together. It was
          contagious. I just couldn’t find anyone like that.”
          <br /><br />
          “What about now?”
          <br /><br />
          Beryl chuckles. “Samantha and I talked a bit last night. She should be
          back in New York by now. Sometimes you think you have something with
          someone.”
          <br /><br />
          “That makes two of us,” agrees Catie. She laughs a little and looks
          out her passenger window. Beryl looks her direction and smiles.

        <p>
          Transition with a screen wipe or fade to show that a little (but not a
          lot of) time passes. Beryl and Catie pull up to a farmhouse
          brilliantly lit with Christmas lights on the trim. It’s dark, but the
          lights on the farmhouse look like glittering stars and bounce off the
          crisp snow. As they’re pulling in front, the screen door opens and out
          walks Jenn followed by Trent. They greet Beryl and Catie with hugs.
          <br /><br />
          “Beryl, why don’t you pull the truck around to the barn,” instructs
          Trent. “We’ll meet you out there.”
          <br /><br />
          Beryl does as he’s instructed. Jenn, Trent, and Catie are not far
          behind, walking from the farmhouse to the barn. Catie and Jenn are
          giggling at something Jenn just said. Trent is just smiling and
          shaking his head. He walks into the barn while Beryl lowers the
          tailgate to the truck.
          <br /><br />
          “I should know better than to have left Catie alone with you two,”
          jokes Beryl. “What’d Jenn say?”
          <br /><br />
          “Just how wonderful we think you are,” says Jenn as Trent re-emerges
          with four pitchforks and hands one to each.
          <br /><br />
          They load hay from inside the barn into the bed of Erin’s truck. It’s
          hard work, but each other’s company makes the time pass pleasantly.
          The four of them are laughing.
          <br /><br />
          Catie asks, “How long have you two lived here?”
          <br /><br />
          Jenn pauses while lifting her pitchfork with hay, “How long has it
          been, Trent? 10 years?”
          <br /><br />
          Trent stands up, takes a break from the lifting. He puts his arm
          around Jenn affectionately. “That’s right. 10 wonderful years.”
          <br /><br />
          Jenn puts her hand on Trent’s chest and leans in. “He used to be a
          doctor.” She smiles and winks at Catie.
          <br /><br />
          Trent looks up and admires the night sky. “And to think, had I been a
          doctor like Bishop, I’d be stuck in an O.R.” He closes his eyes and
          takes a deep breath, drinking in the scenery and company. “But no. No.
          This is where hearts are healed.” They admire the night sky. We see a
          faint shooting star.
        </p>
      </div>
      <hr />
      <div class="text-grey-2">
        <p>
          Another fade shows time passing. Now the truck is full of hay. Trent
          takes the pitchforks from everyone. Catie lifts and closes the
          tailgate. Jenn says, “Let me get us some hot-cocoa.”
          <br /><br />
          Beryl quickly steps to follow Jenn. “Let me help with that, Jenn.” The
          two of them walk into the house.
          <br /><br />
          Catie leans against the truck and stares up at the night sky. Trent
          leans against the truck next to Catie and looks at the sky too.
          “Incredible aren’t they?”
          <br /><br />
          Without looking down, Catie agrees.
          <br /><br />
          “My first Christmas with Jenn was a night like this. That’s when I
          knew she was who I wanted to spend Christmas with for the rest of my
          life.”
          <br /><br />
          Trent waits for a moment, then observes, “Sometimes love lights your
          life up like you’re turning on a Christmas tree for the first time.
          Other times, it grows slowly like a fire and you don’t even realize
          it’s there.”
          <br /><br />
          “Like a George Ford fire?” asks Catie, jokingly.
          <br /><br />
          Trent laughs and agrees. “Like a George Ford fire.” They’re both still
          looking at the sky, but laughing now.
          <br /><br />
          Without looking down, Trent says, “I haven’t seen Beryl happier than
          he was tonight with you. Erin would agree. And I’ve seen how Sarah
          looks at you.”
          <br /><br />
          Catie looks down from the stars and toward the ground. She doesn’t say
          anything. She looks back up. “I’ve had a lot of Christmases with
          nights like this. I actually grew up in a place just like Turnberry.”
          <br /><br />
          Now Trent looks down and toward Catie, listening. She still looks up.
          “That’s why I’ve enjoyed this last week so much.” She sort of laughs.
          “Huh. That’s probably why it’s also been a hard week.”
          <br /><br />
          Trent asks, “What do you mean?”
          <br /><br />
          “My father died when I was Sarah’s age.” She pauses. “Staying in that
          small town made it harder to forget, so my mom and I moved to New
          York. I try to avoid small towns, especially around the holidays.”
          <br /><br />
          Trent just listens. He lets the silence percolate. “So that’s where
          you learned to fork hay so well,” says Trent, trying to lighten the
          mood.
          <br /><br />
          Catie continues. “My dad used to always say, ‘Follow your heart,
          Peanut.’ I’m not sure I’ve been doing that the last few years.”
          <br /><br />

          Trent qets a quizzical look on his face and asks, “What’s a
          ‘heartpeanut?’” This really makes Trent and Catie laugh.
          <br /><br />
          Just then Jenn and Beryl come out of the house with four mugs of hot
          cocoa. “Hey! There’s the good stuff!” says Trent. “The cocoa looks
          pretty good too,” Trent winks at Jenn. Jenn hands one to Trent, who
          greets her with a kiss. Beryl hands one to Catie. She smiles and looks
          in his eyes dreamily. They stand close together. They each sip in
          silence.
          <br /><br />
          Catie breaks the silence. “This town sure does drink a lot of hot
          cocoa!” Beryl laughs and does a spit-take with his hot cocoa. They all
          laugh together. The camera shows a wide panorama of the night sky,
          stars shining brightly. At the bottom of the screen, we see the
          barnyard, the four of them laughing quietly in the distance.

      <hr />
      <div class="text-grey-1">
        <p>
          Next scene shows Catie and Beryl later that night pulling up to the
          ice rink in Erin’s truck. The whole town has gone to bed. The night is
          very still. Beryl puts the truck in park. They pause for a bit.
          Neither say anything. Beryl breaks the silence, “It’s late. We should
          get this hay unloaded.” He starts to open the door, but feels a gentle
          hand on his arm. He stops opening the door and looks back at Catie.
          She’s sitting a little closer than she was before.
          <br /><br />
          “Beryl,” says Catie. “We can get that unloaded tomorrow.” Their faces
          are slowly getting closer.
          <br /><br />
          “Yeah,” agrees Beryl. “It is pretty late. Sorry to keep you out so
          late. But I really enjoyed..., er, appreciated your help.” They lean
          in and kiss ever so gently, but ever so romantically. They break the
          kiss slowly. Then they kiss again, much longer and deeper. Then
          suddenly they break. Catie sorta snickers through her nose after
          realizing what just happened. Beryl runs his hands over the back of
          his head and looks down with a half smile. “I shouldn’t have done
          that. I’m sorry.”
          <br /><br />
          “No,” Catie says quickly, almost cutting off Beryl’s apology. “No,
          I...I,” she stutters, her hands hooked together nervously with only a
          few fingers. “I’m glad you did.” She looks into Beryl’s eyes. “Really
          glad.”
          <br /><br />
          She gets out of the truck and begins to walk back to the bed and
          breakfast. Beryl starts the truck up and puts it into gear. The camera
          pans up as it shows the truck’s tail lights driving up Main Street,
          and Catie is walking slowly across the street to the Bed and
          Breakfast. She puts her hand on the doorknob but doesn’t turn it.
          Instead, she turns around and watches the last of Beryl’s tail lights
          before they turn the corner. Then she opens the door and walks in. The
          street is quietly lit with Christmas lights hanging from the street
          posts.
