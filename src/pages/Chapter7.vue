        The next shot is of the sun just peaking over the mountains that lie
        right next to the town of Turnberry. Looking over the rooftops of the
        town, you can see heavy white smoke coming from numerous chimneys. The
        frozen town looks like it’s under a thin veil of frost. We see Beryl
        pull up to the curb in front of Rachael’s Bed and Breakfast. Catie and
        Blaze are huddled outside in the cold. You can see their breath. They’re
        burying their chins into the collars of their big coats. Beryl’s driving
        a 1967 Ford pickup. Blue. It’s been well taken care of. The engine makes
        a medium rumble as it burns fuel. Beryl stops in front, reaches across
        the bench seat in his truck to open the passenger door for Catie and
        Blaze. Catie hops in and scoots next to Beryl. When they touch, it sends
        a little electricity through both. They look at each other briefly.
        Blaze follows after Catie and sits next to the window.
        <br /><br />
        “Wowww,” admires Blaze. “Nice truck. It must be a ‘67 or ‘68. I’d guess
        a ‘67.”
        <br /><br />
        Beryl is impressed. “You really know your F-series. It’s a ‘67.”
        <br /><br />
        “I could tell by the reflectors on the side. How long have you had it?”
        <br /><br />
        “It’s actually Erin’s. I end up using it the most, so I take care of it.
        It’s name is ‘Carson’.”
        <br /><br />
        Catie pats the dashboard. “Thanks for the ride, Carson.”
        <br /><br />
        “You should upgrade. Get a 2019 Toyota Tacoma,” suggests Blaze.
        <br /><br />
        “Meh, I actually kind of like Carson. He’s comfortable.” Beryl pats the
        dashboard. “Don’t listen to him, Carson. You’re dependable.”
        <br /><br />
        They start driving up Olympus Canyon. Carson has to go a little slower
        to get enough traction up the seldom plowed roads. At one point, the
        wheels start to spin with little traction. The truck starts to slide
        back down, although slowly. Beryl really has to concentrate. He turns
        the large, manual steering wheel sharply to the left, then to the right
        in an effort to get traction. Blaze and Catie are gritting their teeth
        and showing their nerves.
        <br /><br />
        “Is he going to be able to make it up this canyon?” asks Blaze with wide
        eyes. Both he and Catie are bracing themselves with their hands on the
        dashboard. Catie looks at Beryl, anxiously awaiting the answer. Beryl is
        focused on the road and turning the wheel back and forth.
        <br /><br />
        “Oh yeah. He’ll make it,” grunts Beryl in between sharp turns. Carson is
        slowly making progress up the icy patch of the steep hill. “The day may
        come...when the heart of Carson fails….” Slowly, Carson’s wheels start
        to get more traction. Finally, the tires catch back onto asphalt and the
        truck lurches forward up the hill. “But it is not this day!” shouts
        Beryl in triumph. Catie and Blaze relax and breathe a sigh of relief.
        Beryl is all smiles.
        <br />
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        <br />
        Fade to another location further up the canyon. It’s still light out,
        but the sun is past its peak. After another half hour of slowly making
        their way up the winding canyon, Beryl pulls off onto a wide shoulder.
        He puts Carson into park, engages the emergency brake, and turns off the
        engine. “All right. Last stop.” He opens the door. Catie gets out behind
        him. Blaze opens his door and hops out. Blaze walks around the bed of
        the truck and joins Catie and Beryl on the other side. They look back
        the way they came. Down the canyon and in the distance they can see
        Turnberry below.
        <br /><br />
        Blaze breaks the silence. “So we just have to choose one of these trees
        and cut it down?”
        <br /><br />
        Beryl is rummaging through the bed of the truck. He’s loading some saws
        into a backpack. He hoists the pack out of the truck and in one smooth
        motion slings it over his shoulders. “Here? Oh no.” He pulls out three
        pairs of snowshoes. He hands two to Catie who hands one to Blaze. Catie
        knows what to do with them, but Blaze looks at his pair like it’s the
        Rosetta Stone. “Put those on,” instructs Beryl. “I mean, we could get
        one from here. But the really good trees are still a ways away.” Beryl
        starts walking off the road and into the wilderness in his snowshoes.
        <br /><br />
        Blaze looks unsure about this. “You mean we gotta walk?” Catie shrugs
        and starts to follow Beryl.
        <br /><br />
        Beryl calls back over his shoulder, “Only about an hour or so. C’mon!”
        He waves his arm, beckoning them to follow.
        <br />
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        <br />
        The next shots show the passage of time. We see aerial shots of the
        three of them walking along the mountainside. Sometimes the three are
        right next to each other, other times they’re in single file with quite
        a few paces between the three. We see the beautiful mountainside and
        forests sifted in snow like powder sugar on Christmas cookies.
        <br /><br />
        Finally, Beryl comes to the crest of a hill. The camera is looking
        directly into his face. He’s looking slightly down and into the
        distance. A smile slowly creeps across his face but we don’t see what
        he’s looking at. He looks back over his shoulder and waits for Catie to
        catch up. Not far behind her is Blaze. All three have very red cheeks
        and noses. They’re each breathing hard after the long hike. The entire
        frame is filled with their three faces close to each other. Their
        perspiration has started to freeze on their scarves. Beryl watches their
        faces as they get a first look at what he sees. Slowly Catie’s mouth
        opens in wonder. “Wow!” she exclaims softly. Even Blaze is taken aback
        by the sight. Beryl is even happier to see their surprise.
        <br /><br />
        The camera view switches to behind the trio so we can see what they see.
        They look down onto a mountainside that slopes down into a small valley
        below. Below them we see a veritable tree utopia. The valley is filled
        with fir trees ripe for the plucking. The trees look humble, but eager
        to be chosen to be this year’s Nativity Christmas Tree. The snow on the
        floor of the forest is untouched and pristine.
        <br /><br />
        “K. Let’s spread out,” instructs Beryl as he starts walking down into
        the shallow valley to the right.
        <br /><br />
        Blaze and Catie linger for a bit, taking in the sight. Blaze starts
        walking to the left. Catie breaks her stare and starts walking down the
        center of the slope. Beryl shouts, “It needs to be about ten feet tall!”
        <br /><br />
        Catie is closely inspecting each tree. She can only barely hear Blaze in
        the distance, the snow crunching under their feet. She circles tree
        after tree. Some of the trees are missing a lot of needles on one side,
        rendering them unqualified. She’s enjoying this time in nature, with
        just her thoughts. She circles one tree and on closer inspection decides
        it fits Beryl’s description. She stands back and admires her find.
        “Blaze!” she cries out without looking away from her prized tree.
        “Blaze!” No answer. She turns around. Nobody is there. She can’t hear
        anything except silence. She shouts again with her hands cupping her
        mouth. “Blaze!” She’s startled by a pair of hands grabbing her
        shoulders. “Ah!” she yelps as she spins around. It’s not Blaze, but
        Beryl. “You scared me!” Catie exclaims with her hand on her chest.
        <br /><br />
        “Sorry!” apologizes Beryl. “Is everything okay?”
        <br /><br />
        Catie’s hands are on her knees. She’s bent over catching her breath. She
        motions to the tree. “I think I found a good one.”
        <br /><br />
        “Great! Let’s take a look.” Beryl starts to slowly walk around the tree.
        He looks it up and down. “No missing needles,” he thinks out loud while
        inspecting. “Nice and straight spine. Very symmetric. Lots of space for
        ornaments.” He drops his backpack into the snow, unzips it, and starts
        to pull out a saw. “Good job, Catie!” He kneels down and puts the saw
        into place on the trunk.
        <br /><br />
        As he makes contact between the trunk and the saw, Catie hears a chirp.
        “Wait!” She places her hands on Beryl’s shoulders. Beryl slowly looks up
        to see what Catie is looking at. In the inner circle of the tree, about
        seven feet up, hidden in the branches they see a nest with some baby
        birds chirping for their mother. Beryl and Catie look at each other.
        They smile at each other and the miracle they’re witnessing. Beryl gets
        off his knees, slings the backpack over one shoulder, and with saw in
        hand, he and Catie walk elsewhere looking for another tree.
        <br /><br />
        After walking together for a bit, Catie breaks the silence. “So, who’s
        Samantha?”
        <br /><br />
        Beryl is a little surprised by her boldness. He kind of rolls his eyes.
        “She was...this girl. Back in New York. We worked together on the same
        floor. We went on a lot of dates. A lot of dates.” Both he and Catie
        start walking around another tree, inspecting it while conversing. “I
        guess I thought it was turning into something more, but she didn’t.
        Finally, after a while she just stopped returning my calls.” He and
        Catie move onto another tree. “That was about the time I decided to move
        back out here to help out Erin. I just needed to get some fresh air, ya
        know?” Catie nods in understanding.
        <br /><br />
        Beryl asks, “So, you never told me why you only have one turtle dove on
        your necklace.” Catie looks up, opens her mouth like she’s about to
        answer, but closes it and remains silent.
        <br /><br />
        They keep walking for a few paces. Finally, Catie responds. “My dad gave
        it to me for Christmas when I was little.”
        <br /><br />
        “Just the one?”
        <br /><br />
        Catie smiles. “There were two in the set. He gave me one, and he kept
        the other. He said, ‘Catie, you and I are like two turtle doves. We’ll
        always be together for Christmas.’”
        <br /><br />
        “Are you going to see him any time this Christmas?”
        <br /><br />
        “No. He died a few weeks before the Christmas just before I met Blaze at
        school.”
        <br /><br />

        “Oh, Catie, I’m so sorry.” Beryl stops in his tracks. Catie walks a
        little ahead then stops and turns around.
        <br /><br />
        “No. It’s okay. You didn’t know.” They keep trudging through the snow.
        Beryl isn’t sure what to say. Catie continues after a few moments of
        silence. “After he died, my mom and I went through all his stuff, but we
        just couldn’t find that other turtle dove.” She starts to get a little
        teary eyed. “I must’ve looked everywhere for it. But no dove.”
        <br /><br />
        Beryl and Catie stop in their tracks to rest for a bit. She continues.
        “I must have prayed...a thousand times for my dad to get better. But he
        didn’t.” One of her eyes gets a little too full of tears, and one single
        tear trickles down her cheek. “And after he died, I prayed...a thousand
        times to find that turtle dove. But we didn’t.”
        <br /><br />
        “Oh, Catie.” Beryl isn’t sure what to say. He puts an arm around Catie.
        <br /><br />
        Catie continues, a little frustration behind her words and tears. “I
        mean, it’s one lousy turtle dove necklace. Why couldn’t God let me find
        one lousy turtle dove necklace.” She pauses and starts to gather her
        emotions. “And that’s...when...I sort of stopped believing that
        Christmas was anything more than a time to get good deals on sweaters
        and electronics.”
        <br /><br />
        “I hate to break it to ya, but the deals around here aren’t even that
        good,” informs Beryl dryly. Catie laughs through the remnants of her
        tears.
        <br /><br />
        Just then Blaze appears out of nowhere. “Hey guys!” He’s a little out of
        breath, but has a big smile on his cold, red face. “I found one.”
