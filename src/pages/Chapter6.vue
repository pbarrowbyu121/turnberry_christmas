      <p>
        Fade in to an exterior shot of the front of a snow-covered church
        building. Large pillars extend from the church’s stoop to hold up the
        roof. Atop sits a beautiful single spire that reaches toward the
        heavens. At the base of the steeple is a large clock. It reads 7:00 and
        the church bells start ringing seven loud “bongs” to mark the time. It’s
        evening and the wintry dark has started settling over the town. There’s
        a nativity scene out front. People are walking in, couples at a time,
        families at a time. Each is carrying some homemade dish, usually covered
        in tinfoil, many are burned along the edges. Lots of potato dishes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Catie is standing outside not far from the entrance. People brush past
        her on their way in. She stares at the tall spire with some hesitancy,
        deep in thought. She occasionally looks down and watches other people
        walking in. She’s nervous and can’t quite bring herself to just walk.
        Rachael from the bed and breakfast is walking up behind Catie. She
        greets Catie with the hug of a sweet aunt. “You decided to come!” says
        Rachael, still mid-hug. Catie is actually really glad to see Rachael’s
        friendly face.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rachael begins to walk in, but Catie still hesitates to follow. Rachael
        looks back, a little confused. Rachael chuckles, “It’s perfectly safe,
        dear!”
      </p>
      <p>
        This jars Catie back from her deep thought. She makes up an excuse, “Oh,
        I just feel bad because I didn’t bring anything.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Rachael walks back to Catie and puts her arm around Catie’s shoulders.
        She semi-whispers, “We’ll just tell people you helped me make my dish. I
        think I made enough charcuterie to feed all of Bethlehem.” She winks at
        Catie. This puts a smile on Catie’s face, but she’s still not convinced.
        “Well don’t just stand out here, hon! You’ll catch a cold!” urges
        Rachael again. Finally Catie holds her breath and takes the plunge.
        Rachael and Catie walk in together, Rachael’s arm still around Catie.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside the church’s foyer is a crowd of people handing their dinner
        dishes to each other so they can remove their heavy coats, then holding
        others’ dishes so the process can be repeated. There’s a cacophony of
        greetings and excitement. Catie doesn’t stray far from Rachael, and
        doesn’t say much either. Rachael is proudly showing her neighbors her
        charcuterie and doting over their respective dishes. Catie is a little
        overwhelmed but has a smile on her face. Gradually the crowd starts to
        make their way into the dining area. It’s actually a basketball gym that
        has been temporarily converted into a great dining hall complete with
        garland, holly, and beautifully decorated Christmas trees. The crowd of
        neighbors gradually trickles into the gym. Catie’s uncertainty makes her
        hang back until she is the only one in the foyer. She begins to look
        around at her new surroundings. It’s quiet again, in her solitude. But
        she can still hear the congregation humming with friendly conversation
        in the dining area.
      </p>
      <p>
        She sees a display case above a bookshelf with photos. She walks over
        slowly. And begins to study them closer. She sees pictures of people
        smiling doing various activities in groups. She sees a barbecue and
        recognizes Kelly, the mechanic, flipping burgers, wearing a “Kiss the
        Cook” apron, feeding his neighbors. She sees a group of people standing
        in front of the church, the men in suits and ties, the women in lovely
        dresses covered in flowers. It’s spring. They are close together, arms
        around each other, smiling at the camera. She sees Rachael, Lauren, and
        other women sitting in chairs in a circle, eating a big meal at
        someone’s home. The photos aren’t professional, but what they capture
        can’t be obtained by even the best photographers. She sees another group
        photo on a softball field, twelve men and women huddled together wearing
        jeans and t-shirts holding baseball gloves in front of the chain-link
        backstop. They’re each holding up the “We’re number 1” sign. There’s a
        picture of various individuals helping an elderly woman move into her
        house.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing the sense of community in these photos is contagious and puts a
        smile on Catie’s face. She sees a photo of a handsome gentleman Catie
        recognizes. It’s Beryl. The photo looks about 10 years old. He looks
        especially sharp in this one, wearing a fine tailored suit. He’s
        standing in front of the church with two individuals she doesn’t
        recognize. A man and a woman. The man is also quite handsome, bald,
        physically fit, fills out his slim-cut suit rather nicely. The woman is
        tall and elegant. Her blonde hair flows down over her shoulders. She’s
        wearing a gorgeous pencil skirt. It’s summer in the photo. The three of
        them are standing close together, facing the camera and smiling. Beryl
        is standing on the outside of the trio but has his arm around the
        shoulders of both. The woman is holding up a beautiful baby girl that
        can’t be more than a few months old. She’s wearing the cutest little
        white dress. Her eyes are closed and her fists are clenched. Catie
        recognizes the mother as the woman helping at the skating shack.
      </p>
      <p>
        She’s awakened from this photographic trance when Rachael comes back
        into the foyer from the gym. She’s wearing a corny Christmas sweater
        over a white turtleneck. She looks comfy. “Oh there you are, hon!” She
        walks quicker toward Catie. “I was wondering where you were. I’ve saved
        you a seat.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Catie is a little embarrassed. “Oh, I was...just...using the bathroom.”
        She smiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rachael makes a skeptical smile at Catie. “You know, hon, you shouldn’t
        lie inside a church.” Catie lowers her head and smiles guiltily. She and
        Rachael walk into the dining area, make their way to Rachael’s table and
        sit down. The rest of the table has already started their meal.
      </p>
      <p>
        A couple in their early thirties are at the table. The wife has a baby
        on her lap and a toddler sitting next to her. She’s busy attending to
        both. Feeding the baby and making sure the toddler doesn’t make too much
        of a mess. The husband is shoveling a spoonful of funeral potatoes into
        his mouth. A man in his fifties is also at the table with his wife. He’s
        bald, except for a silver crown of hair surrounding his head. His wife
        looks ten years younger but is in fact the same age. A few other
        couples, similar in age to the first are also at the table. But they
        don’t have any children, or if they do, they’re not at the table. Beryl
        and Erin are also sitting here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rachael introduces Catie to the table as they sit down. “Everyone, I’d
        like you to meet Catie. She and her boyfriend are my guests this week.”
        Everyone mumbles a “hello” or a “Hi, Catie.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Catie, this is Brock and Emma and their two kids. This is Bishop and
        Melony. His real name is Blake, but we call him Bishop because he’s also
        our bishop.” The middle-aged man and woman wave hello. “This is Esther
        and Derek.” The other couple in their late twenties wave hello. “And I
        think you’ve met Beryl and this is Erin. Down at the end is Chella and
        Dallan. And last but certainly not least is Cassandra and Zach.” The
        various couples at the table each take turns waving hello on cue.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Sooo, Catie! A romantic getaway!” begins Brock while cutting some ham.
      </p>
      <p>
        Emma says, “We haven’t had a romantic getaway in 5 years.” She’s
        bouncing her baby on her lap.
      </p>
      <p>
        “We had a little romance last night,” says Derek with some optimism.
      </p>
      <p>
        His wife, Esther stops cutting her food. She’s clearly remembering last
        night differently. She looks to her side at Derek. “We watched the
        fireplace on Netflix,” she counters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Derek offers further evidence, a little slower so she’ll understand.
        “...which was romantic.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Those fires are fake,” ventures Rachael, putting a fork full of ham
        into her mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Melony, ever the romantic, says to Catie, “Sounds like a hallmark movie
        in the making.”
      </p>
      <p>Blake leans into the table and jokes, “Speaking of fake…”</p>
      <p>
        The pace of the conversation starts to pick up. People are talking over
        others. As each one talks, they barely leave enough time for the last
        person to finish their sentence. Derek gets a little defensive. “Those
        fires are not fake. They’re made by George Ford.”
      </p>
      <p>“The man’s a fire building genius,” Brock adds.</p>
      <p>“They always fall in love in a week. A week!” blurts Erin.</p>
      <p>“His fires last an hour, un-aided,” retorts Derek on the defense.</p>
      <p>
        “That’s what Beryl needs to happen to him,” suggests Erin to no one in
        particular.
      </p>
      <p>“Because they’re CGI. That’s why,” counters Emma.</p>
      <p>“I think they use real actors,” says Melony, a little confused.</p>
      <p>
        “You put a camera in front of a fireplace. Why use CGI?” Derek is
        demonstrating the action of putting a camera in front of a fireplace
        with his hands.
      </p>
      <p>“They use shaving cream. For snow. Shaving cream,” jabs Zach.</p>
      <p>“Don’t say such things. That’s nonsense,” cries Derek.</p>
      <p>“You cannot build a fire that lasts an hour,” argues Rachael.</p>
      <p>“Unless your name is George Ford,” explains Brock.</p>
      <p>
        Beryl and Catie are just trying to eat, but can’t help laugh at the
        chaos.
      </p>
      <p>“The actors may as well be CGI. Or wood,” jokes Emma.</p>
      <p>“The best ones are all made in Canada,” observes Melony.</p>
      <p>
        “Do fires burn differently that far north?” wonders Brock, a little
        confused.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Mmmm. This beef has a nice kick,” exclaims Rachael with wide eyes.
        “What’d you put in this?”
      </p>
      <p>“It’s gas. That’s the secret,” states Erin, matter-of-factly.</p>
      <p>
        Beryl and Catie can barely keep their food in their mouth, listening to
        everyone trip over each other. They catch each other’s eyes and see the
        other chuckling. It takes everything they’ve got to stifle their
        laughter. But in between the laughter, they see a bright twinkle in each
        other’s eyes when they look at each other.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Fade out of this shot to show time passing. Fade back into the kitchen
        at the Church. The dishes have all been cleared into the medium-sized
        kitchen that sits just off the gym. The group has unceremoniously
        organized themselves into a clean-up crew. There weren’t any assignments
        formally handed out. Rather, each just saw a need to be filled and took
        the initiative. Some are putting up folding chairs, others are taking
        down the tables. Brock takes a large dust mop and begins sweeping the
        floor. Catie is quick to catch on and ends up next to Beryl at the sink.
        Beryl is washing, Catie is drying. Along with them is Erin, rinsing. A
        few of the women are at the counter putting tin foil on top of leftovers
        and sending them home with various members. In walks Madi, a teacher at
        the local middle school. She’s shorter than average, but what she lacks
        in height she makes up for in a boisterous laugh and big smile. She
        walks with purpose toward Beryl.
      </p>
      <p>
        Standing behind Beryl, Madi beckons. “Beryl, there you are.” Beryl looks
        behind his shoulder to acknowledge Madi, but doesn’t break his
        concentration on the dishes. “Have you been assigned a job for the
        Nativity yet?”
      </p>
      <p>“Not yet. How can I help?”</p>
      <p>
        “Well, I was hoping you could be in charge of getting hay for the
        Nativity.”
      </p>
      <p>“Of course.”</p>
      <p>
        “Great! Trent and Jenn have already volunteered their supply. Can you
        coordinate with them on pick-up?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Beryl turns around and leans back against the counter. He dries his
        hands with the towel hanging on his shoulder. He tenses his brow in
        concentration, already planning in his head what needs to be done.
        “Sure. You bet.”
      </p>
      <p>Catie interrupts. “I’d love to help. Is there anything I can do?”</p>
      <p>
        Beryl and Madi are both caught a little off guard. They’re a little
        speechless, surprised at the stranger’s willingness to jump in and help.
        Catie can tell so she says, “Well, I’m gonna be here for a whole week.
        ‘When in Rome…’,” she offers with a nervous tone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Madi is still a little unsure if her plans can be rearranged to
        accommodate Catie’s offer. “Well, I was going to pick out a Christmas
        tree for the Nativity tomorrow but don’t think I’ll have time. Why don’t
        you and Blaze do that for me?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “We’d love to!” Catie exclaims. Then it dawns on her. “Oh, but our car
        is in the shop.” She’s a little embarrassed that her offer to help is
        foiled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beryl steps in. “Don’t worry about it Madi. I can give them a ride.”
      </p>
      <p>
        This further embarrases Catie. “Oh no, you don’t have to do that,” Catie
        insists. Madi looks at Catie.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beryl counters. “Someone does. You just said your boyfriend doesn’t know
        how to drive.” Madi looks back at Beryl.
      </p>
      <p>
        “That’s not what what I said,” glares Catie, nearly clenching her teeth.
        Madi looks back at Catie.
      </p>
      <p>“It was implied.”</p>
      <p>
        “It was not implied. ‘Imply’ refers to giving information. You inferred
        my boyfriend doesn’t know how to drive.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Beryl holds his hand up to silence Catie. “Irregardless. Just be humble
        and let me help.” Catie is a little perturbed by this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Madi is tired of looking back and forth between the two. She rolls her
        eyes. “Look, just sort it out amongst yourselves.” Madi walks off, but
        not quickly enough that she can’t be heard muttering, “Worse than my 7th
        graders.”
