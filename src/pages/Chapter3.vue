        Cut to Blaze and Catie driving along more country highway. They hear
        hissing coming from the under the hood and the car suddenly starts to
        jerk and slow down. They pull off to the side of the road. Catie
        suggests Blaze go look at it but he says he really shouldn’t because
        he’s wearing a brand new sport coat. Catie begrudgingly gets out of the
        car. She rolls up her sleeves and pops the hood. She’s blasted with
        steam and warm air. She swats it away with her arms. “I’m not sure what
        it is, but I don’t think we’re gonna make it to the cabin.” She puts
        both arms on the front of the car to support herself.
      </p>
      <p>Blaze is dejected. “We’re not?”</p>
      <p>“Not without a tow truck,” responds Catie.</p>
      <p>
        Cut to a shot of Blaze and Catie walking along the country road back
        toward Turnberry. “I’ve always wanted to meet Gomer and see his garage,”
        says Blaze deridingly. “Maybe Sheriff Andy can point us in the right
        direction.” He laughs at his own joke. Catie doesn’t. Blaze stops
        laughing when he sees that Catie isn’t. “Oh yeah. I forgot. I was just
        kidding, Catie.” Catie is still not pleased.
      </p>
      <p>
        After walking for a while longer, Blaze says, “Look, Catie. I was hoping
        I’d be ready for...certain things to happen this Christmas. Between us.
        But I just need a little longer to think about things.”
      </p>
      <p>“Blaze, you’ve been thinking for two years!” Exclaims Catie.</p>
      <p>
        “I know. It’s just...sometimes I think, ‘What if there’s something
        better out there?’” He can tell Catie doesn’t like the sound of this. He
        tries to explain himself. “I like you Catie. A lot. But don’t you ever
        think about that?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “When you say that I do,” scoffs Catie. She rolls her eyes in
        frustration.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Cut to a tow truck stopped on the side of the road next to Blaze’s
        Mercedes Benz. A man, Kelly, and his wife, Lauren, co-owners of the
        town’s garage, are looking at the Benz. They’re both wearing coveralls.
        Lauren is the one under the hood. “What do you see, honey?” asks Kelly.
        Kelly is leaning against the Benz next to Blaze and Catie. He’s holding
        a clipboard and taking info from Blaze. Lauren explains that the
        radiator is broken. Kelly says he’s not the real mechanic. She is. He
        runs the numbers, she fixes the cars.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lauren pops her head up from under the head and walks toward Catie,
        Blaze, and Kelly. She’s wiping her greasy hands with a rag. “We’re gonna
        have to tow it back to the shop.”
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Cut to the garage in town. Blaze and Catie are sitting in the waiting
        room. Kelly comes out from behind the counter and invites Blaze into his
        office to explain. “Lauren was right. It’s the radiator. The really bad
        news is that It’s going to take at least a week to get all the parts we
        need,” explains Kelly. Blaze is outraged at the supposed incompetence of
        these small town mechanics.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Nobody drives a 2017 Mercedes Benz in these parts,” says Kelly
        patiently. He can tell this is a crucial conversation so he’s handling
        it quite well. Blaze, on the other hand, isn’t.
      </p>
      <p>
        Catie is sitting outside the main office on a chair. You can hear the
        muffled conversation between Kelly, Lauren, and Blaze in the main
        office. Blaze’s voice is a little more raised than the others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beryl walks into the waiting area. He catches Catie’s eyes as she
        vaguely recognizes him from earlier that morning. He notices (and the
        camera shows) the turtle dove necklace Catie’s wearing. He approaches
        her and asks, “Excuse me, do you know if Kelly or Lauren are here?”
      </p>
      <p>Catie looks up. “Who?” She squints her eyes in confusion.</p>
      <p>
        “Kelly and Lauren. They run this place.” He points at the garage all
        around them.
      </p>
      <p>“Oh. I’m sorry. I just don’t know who they are.”</p>
      <p>
        Beryl makes a guess. “You’re not from around here, are you.” He’s not
        smiling, but he’s not frowning.
      </p>
      <p>“No, I’m not. How could you tell?” asks Catie.</p>
      <p>
        “Well, for one, you don’t know who Kelly and Lauren are. And two, you’re
        sitting in the chair everyone knows not to sit in because of the big
        grease stain in the middle.” He says this matter-of-factly without
        remorse for her misfortune.
      </p>
      <p>
        Catie quickly stands up with a “Oh!” and immediately begins assessing
        the damage to her jeans. “Can this day get worse?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Why don’t we ask the two guys that fell from ladders?” Beryl says in
        seriousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Catie is a little embarrassed. She starts to say something, “That
        wasn’t…”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Hopefully the repairs don’t take long so you can drive like that
        elsewhere.”
      </p>
      <p>Catie is very offended. She’s speechless.</p>
      <p>
        Lauren comes out of the office. “Beryl!” She’s happy to see him. “What
        brings you here?”
      </p>
      <p>“Erin’s truck, actually. Just needs some new brakes.”</p>
      <p>
        “Where’s Erin?” Lauren cranes her neck to look outside to see if Erin
        came along.
      </p>
      <p>
        “She’s helping out Dallan and Derek back at the shack.” Beryl glares at
        Catie. Catie sort of cowers. She’s not sure who Dallan and Derek are,
        but she’s uncomfortable with Beryl staring daggers at her.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Ohh. I heard about that,” says Lauren. “Some maniac speeding down main
        street. Well, let’s take a look.” She and Beryl walk out front to look
        at Erin’s truck.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kelly and Blaze come storming out of the office. Blaze is flustered.
        Upset. He gathers Catie and they storm out to go get a room at the bed
        and breakfast. Kelly tries to soften the situation. “Look. Down the
        street not far from here is a bed and breakfast. I’m sure if I explained
        the situation to Rachael, she’d be happy to have you. Our treat.”
