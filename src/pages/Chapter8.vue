        Next shot, we see a shot of blue sky with the sun in the center of the
        screen. Nothing else. The point of view is from the ground, looking up.
        You hear a group of people grunting, and pushing. The top couple of feet
        of the Christmas tree found by Blaze steadily pivots into frame as it’s
        stood up. Finally, when the tree is perfectly straight in the frame, it
        eclipses the sun from our view. That’s when you hear cheers from the
        crowd off-screen. A brass band plays the hallelujah chords from Handel’s
        Messiah in celebration.
        <br /><br />
        Now we see that we’re at Erin’s skating rink. The town has gathered to
        officially begin decorating for the Nativity on Ice. Some are sitting in
        chairs at tables that have been set up. Others are standing with
        styrofoam cups of hot chocolate in their hands. Madi gets in front of
        the crowd and gestures for them to give her their attention. She has a
        big smile on her face. Gradually the crowd settles down.
        <br /><br />
        Madi announces, “Let’s give a big round of applause to Blaze and Catie,
        our guests, for finding such a perfect tree!”
        <br /><br />
        The crowd applauds and we see Blaze and Catie standing together bundled
        up, proud of their find. They’re sipping on their hot cocoa.
        <br /><br />
        Beryl is sitting at a table with Brock, Emma, Derek, Esther, Erin,
        Blake, Melony, etc. They’re all chatting, but Beryl is looking over his
        shoulder at Blaze and Catie with intent. He has a very serious look on
        his face as he sips his cocoa. Brock is sitting across the table and
        observing Beryl while sipping his cocoa. Emma is bouncing her youngest
        on her lap. Beryl sees Brock out of the corner of his eye. He’s caught
        in the act. “What?” Beryl feigns innocence. Brock just lets a smile
        slowly creep across his face. It’s really more half a smile. “What?”
        asks Beryl again.
        <br /><br />
        “Nothing!” Brock puts his hands up in defense. He offers a nugget of
        wisdom: “ ‘Jealousy, that dragon which slays love under the pretence of
        keeping it alive.’ -Ellis.”
        <br /><br />
        “Since when do you quote literature?” teases Beryl.
        <br /><br />
        “I read,” says Brock. Beryl gives him a skeptical look. “I read!”
        insists Brock.
        <br /><br />
        Emma chimes in, “I got him a ‘Quote-A-Day’ calendar last Christmas.”
        <br /><br />
        “But I also like to read!” Brock defends himself. The table laughs.
        <br /><br />
        Catie walks behind Beryl and puts her hand on Beryl’s shoulder. Beryl is
        surprised and looks up. Blaze isn’t with her. “Hey,” he says as he
        quickly stands up from his chair.
        <br /><br />
        “Hey.” Catie points behind her with her thumbs. “I was wondering if you
        wanted to help me put lights on our tr….er, mine and Blaze’s tree.”
        <br /><br />
        “You bet!” They both walk away. The couples still sitting at the table
        smile at each other.
        <br /><br />
        Beryl and Catie kneel down at the base of the tree. Beryl starts to
        drape lights around the tree in a circle, laying the strand of lights
        across the branches.
        <br /><br />
        “What are you doing?” asks Catie.
        <br /><br />
        Beryl stops what he’s doing but doesn’t say anything. He’s not sure what
        she’s talking about.
        <br /><br />
        “Is that how you put lights on a tree?” teases Catie.
        <br /><br />
        “Yes!” insists Beryl playfully.
        <br /><br />
        “You’re doing it wrong.”
        <br /><br />
        “Oh? Show me how it’s done, Charlie Brown.”
        <br /><br />
        “You’ve got to wrap the lights around each individual branch.” She takes
        the lights from Beryl and starts demonstrating what she’s talking about.
        “You start on the outside of the tree and wrap toward the trunk, then
        back out.” She’s smiling and laughing, having a good time with Beryl.
        “In and out.”
        <br /><br />
        “Let me try.” He takes up where Catie left off.
        <br /><br />
        Catie stands back, “Yeah that’s right.” She leans over Beryl and guides
        his hands with hers.
        <br /><br />
        Then Sarah comes up behind them. “Beryl, there’s a pretty girl here to
        see you.” Beryl and Catie slowly stand up. They both turn around. At the
        edge of the skating rink and crowds of people is a tall, slender woman
        in her late twenties. Her dark brown hair is pulled back tight into a
        ponytail. She’s wearing tight jeans, heels, and a leather jacket. She
        looks good.
        <br /><br />
        “What’s she doing h…” says Beryl under his breath with a furrowed brow.
        He quickly hands the lights over to Catie. He brushes his hands on his
        pants and stands up. “Excuse me.” He briskly walks over to Samantha.
        Catie continues to stare as he walks off.
        <br /><br />
        “Catie,” Sarah says trying to get Catie’s attention. “Catie.” Catie is
        tuning her out. She’s distracted by whoever this woman is that has
        grabbed Beryl’s attention so fully. “Catie!”
        <br /><br />
        Finally Catie acknowledges Sarah. “What, dear?”
        <br /><br />
        “Who is that?” Sarah asks. She points toward the woman.
        <br /><br />
        “I’m not sure,” Catie says slowly.
        <br /><br />
        “Catie?” Sarah pulls on Catie’s coat. “Can you help me practice my lines
        for the Nativity?”
        <br /><br />
        Catie kneels down to Sarah’s level. “I’d love to!”
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Cut over to Beryl and Samantha. Beryl is walking briskly up to Samantha.
        <br /><br />
        “Samantha!” He’s surprised and confused. “What are you doing here?”
        <br /><br />
        “Hi, Beryl,” says Samantha in an excited voice. She reaches out for a
        hug but Beryl doesn’t reciprocate. Samantha still hugs him and lingers.
        “I thought I’d spend Christmas with you and your friends this year.”
        <br /><br />
        Beryl is a little unsure of what to say. He looks a little upset and a
        little confused.
        <br /><br />
        “What’s wrong?” asks Samantha. “You don’t look happy to see me.”
        <br /><br />
        “I haven’t heard from you for months. Can you blame me if I thought you
        weren’t interested?”
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Cut back to Catie and Sarah. They’re sitting at a table. Catie is
        holding a notecard listening to Sarah, but keeping one eye on Beryl and
        Samantha. Sarah quotes from memory, “‘Fear not, for behold I bring
        you...I bring you…,”
        <br /><br />
        Catie helps her out. “‘Good tidings.”
        <br /><br />
        “‘Good tidings!’ Catie? What’s ‘Good tidings?’”
        <br /><br />
        “Hmm. Good tidings is like...news that will make you happy.”
        <br /><br />
        Sarah continues. “‘Good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all
        people.’”
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Cut back to Samantha and Beryl. Samantha says innocently, “I didn’t want
        to respond to all your texts, Beryl. I was trying to play
        ‘hard-to-get.’”
        <br /><br />
        “Samantha.” Beryl shakes his head. He’s frustrated. Not sure where to
        begin. “Listen, Sam. Sometimes I’d ask you out and you’d turn it down to
        spend time with your girlfriends.”
        <br /><br />
        “Well, I figured if you were truly interested, you’d keep trying.”
        <br /><br />
        “Sam, no! You were behaving the exact same way a girl that’s not
        interested would.” Beryl sighs.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Cut back to Sarah and Catie. Sarah is struggling, but Catie is really
        enjoying helping her. Sarah tries, “‘And this shall be a sign unto you;
        ye shall...ye shall find….’” Sarah gets a little upset with herself. She
        throws her hands up in defeat. “I can’t do this!”
        <br /><br />
        Catie tries to comfort her. “Hey! Don’t be ridiculous. You’ll be great.”
        <br /><br />
        “But what if I forget the angel’s lines?”
        <br /><br />
        “Look at me. Look at me,” Catie grabs Sarah by the shoulders, crouches
        down, and makes eye contact. “I’m gonna be there in the audience.
        Pretend like you’re telling just me. Mkay?”
        <br /><br />
        Sarah smiles. “Okay.”
        <br /><br />
        Catie smiles too. She looks in the distance to check on Beryl. She sees
        Samantha kiss Beryl. Catie’s eyes go wide.
        <br /><br />
        Blaze walks over to Catie and Sarah. He’s drinking some hot cocoa from a
        styrofoam cup. He asks, “Who’s the hot girl kissing Beryl?”
        <br /><br />
        In the distance, we see Beryl push Samantha away and start to walk away,
        back toward Catie, Sarah, and Blaze. He’s shaking his head. Samantha
        stays where she is and watches Beryl walk away.
        <br /><br />
        Catie gets a look of fire in her eyes. She abruptly stands up and plants
        a big, long kiss on Blaze. Blaze is a little caught off guard, but
        enjoys it. Beryl abruptly stops in his tracks. He has a defeated and
        surprised look. Catie breaks the kiss and looks first at Beryl to make
        sure he saw. He most certainly did. When their eyes meet, Beryl quickly
        looks away.
        <br /><br />
        One of Sarah’s friends, Hannah, leads a group of kids over to where
        Sarah, Blaze, and Beryl are now standing. “Sarah, c’mon! Let’s have a
        snowball fight!”
        <br /><br />
        Sarah shouts, “Yayy!” She forgets all about practicing for the Nativity.
        She turns to her grown-up friends. “Beryl, will you come snowball fight
        with us?” Beryl hesitates. He’s really not feeling like playing with a
        bunch of children right now. “Pleasssse!” Sarah begs. “We need more
        people.” Behind her, Hannah and her gang of girls and boys, echo Sarah.
        They shout, “Pleassse!” This melts Beryl’s heart. Then Sarah turns to
        Catie. “Catie! Will you come play with us?” Beryl is a little curious
        what she’ll say.
        <br /><br />
        “Sure,” smiles Catie. She reaches out her hand for Sarah. Sarah grasps
        it and leads her into the battlefield. Beryl follows.
        <br /><br />
        Blaze drains the rest of his cocoa and slams his styrofoam cup down on
        the table. “Sounds fun!” he exclaims. “I want in.” He wipes his mouth
        with the back of his hand and joins his fellow recruits.
        <br /><br />
        They walk through the crowds of people still decorating the newly found
        Christmas tree and the surrounding area. Cassandra and Esther are
        placing oversized gift-wrapped boxes under the tree. Chella is putting
        lights on a tree (the correct way). Madi is directing traffic. Derek is
        putting donuts and hot chocolate out on a table for everyone. The
        children along with Beryl, Catie, and Blaze arrive at the battle field.
        <br /><br />
        “Alright, kids,” starts Blaze. “If there’s anything I know, it’s
        snowball fights. Line up. Right here.” He makes a gesture with his hands
        drawing an imaginary line in the snow. “I’ll assign you to a side. We’ll
        need someone to be the lieutenant, someone to be the sergeant, a
        captain, and the rest will be priv…” He’s interrupted with a snowball
        hitting the side of his face. It catches him off guard. He freezes
        mid-gesture. He looks up to see Sarah packing another snowball in her
        hands.
        <br /><br />
        “That’s too many words,” says Sarah. Beryl and Catie are snickering.
        <br /><br />
        “It’s too many what, now?” asks Blaze, wiping the snow off his face.
        <br /><br />
        “Too many WORDS.” Sarah screams the last word. Someone throws another
        snowball and it hits Sarah. Sarah laughs. “Hey!” We see Beryl getting
        another snowball ready. The other children join in the screaming at the
        top of their lungs and start scooping up snow and hurling it at one
        another. It’s a bloodbath of a snowball fight. Beryl joins in the
        screaming, scooping, and throwing. Catie catches on and joins in. Blaze
        concedes and joins too. The other grown ups decorating and sitting at
        the tables smile as they watch.
        <br /><br />
        “Beryl, Beryl,” nags Sarah. “Be the abominable snowman!”
        <br /><br />
        Beryl drops the snowball he was forming, puts his arms above his head
        and transforms into the abominable snowman. He takes giant steps towards
        the children. He growls, “Aaarrrgh! I’m the abominable snowman!” The
        children squeal in excitement and run away from Beryl.
        <br /><br />
        Catie lets her imagination run with it. She spreads her arms. “Attack
        the abominable snowman!” She starts to throw snowballs at Beryl.
        <br /><br />
        The other kids echo her. “Attack the abominable snowman!” they each
        squeal in turn. Beryl grabs some of the children, hoists them over his
        head, or around his back, and gently puts them back onto the ground. All
        this while being bombarded with snowballs.
        <br /><br />
        Catie steps back and brushes the snow off her pants. She’s lost in her
        thoughts as she smiles and watches Beryl play with the children. They
        all have smiles on their faces.
        <br /><br />
        Blaze tries to play along. “Now I’m the abominable snowman!” The
        children start to turn on Blaze, throwing snowballs at him. He gets
        hammered.
        <br /><br />
        Beryl rallies the troops. “Get him!” They start throwing snowballs at
        him. Blaze playfully picks some of the children up while simultaneously
        protecting himself with his arms. Catie also throws a few snowballs.
        <br /><br />
        Beryl is having a good time throwing snowballs along with the children.
        He gets carried away with the fun and lets his million dollar arm sling
        a tightly packed snowball. It hits Blaze square in the eye. Blaze lets
        out a loud but short, “Ah!” as he grabs his eye with both his hands and
        falls backward into the snow.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Next shot we see is from the interior of Erin’s skate shack. The door
        abruptly opens. Erin and Catie have Blaze slung between their shoulders.
        Samantha is walking in as well with an ice pack. Beryl is walking behind
        with his hands spread wide. “I said I’m sorry!” They set Blaze on a
        bench leaning up against a wall. Samantha hands him the ice pack and he
        places it over his eye.
        <br /><br />
        In walks Bishop with a medical bag. “Where’s the victim?” He pulls out a
        pen light from his pocket and walks toward Blaze. He moves Blaze’s hands
        away from his face and looks into his eyes with the pen light.
        <br /><br />
        Beryl is standing outside the shack, watching. Catie leaves Blaze in
        Bishop’s and Erin’s care and storms out of the shack towards Beryl.
        Catie throws an accusation: “You did that on purpose!”
        <br /><br />
        “Excuse me?” Beryl is caught off guard.
        <br /><br />
        “You heard me.” Catie starts to walk back to Blaze.
        <br /><br />
        “Yeah?!” retorts Beryl. “Well, maybe I did.”
        <br /><br />
        Catie stops in her tracks. “Excuse me?”
        <br /><br />
        Beryl backtracks. “Nothing,” he says quietly, putting his head down.
        <br /><br />
        “No. What did you just say?” insists Catie, turning back around and
        walking back to within inches of Beryl’s face.
        <br /><br />
        “Maybe someone who is as blind as he is deserves to get one to the eye,”
        says Beryl, looking Catie directly in the eye.
        <br /><br />
        Catie opens her mouth to say something, but struggles to find words.
        Finally she says, “You’re just jealous!” She is surprised she said it.
        <br /><br />
        “You say that like you expect me to believe he’s right for you.”
        <br /><br />
        “And you say that like you expect me to believe you don’t still have
        feelings for Samantha!”
        <br /><br />
        Madi approaches the skate shack “Is now a bad time?” she asks. Beryl and
        Catie look at Madi at the same time. They don’t say anything but have
        fire in their eyes. Madi gets the hint. Her eyes go wide. “I just wanted
        to remind you that you agreed to go get the hay tomorrow from Trent’s
        place.” Madi starts to walk away. After a few steps she turns around.
        “You may want to get some help, Beryl. It’s a two man job.”
