        This is a work of fiction. Its intent is to entertain and should not be
        seen as anything more or less. It presents the development of a
        relationship over a short period of time, but it should be noted that
        real relationships take hard work over long periods of time. Do not let
        such stories create unrealistic expectations.
      </p>
      <p>Merry Christmas!</p>
