      <p>
        Cut to the skating rink. Day. The sky is clear blue. The reflection of
        the sun off the bright white snow hurts the eyes. That day, final
        preparations are being made for the Nativity On Ice. The ice rink is
        really starting to come together. People are gathered at the rink to
        finish the last details. Catie is at the rink (she was one of the first
        to arrive), thoroughly enjoying the company of her new-found second
        family. She’s chatting with the people she’s gotten to know over the
        last 5-6 days as they’ve put their all into decorating for the most
        important week of the year.
        <br /><br />
        She stands up and to the side of all the action to take it all in with a
        big smile. Behind her, Beryl walks up and joins her. “Good morning,
        small town girl!” he says to Catie in the brisk, cold air as he stands
        really close next to her.
        <br /><br />
        “Hey, city slicker!” responds Catie. They both chuckle.
        <br /><br />
        They can see Sarah helping along with some of the other little girls in
        the town. They’re setting up fake animals in the stable on the ice. They
        talk about how the decorating and preparing for the Nativity is really
        coming along nicely. Beryl really talks up the show. He says he looked
        forward to flying out from New York each year to see the production and
        spend Christmas with Peter and Erin. He says the production itself isn’t
        what makes it special. It’s knowing the people that are putting their
        heart and soul into something they care deeply about. “That’s what makes
        Christmas so special. Spending it with people you care deeply about,”
        says Beryl. They’re practically in each other’s arms by now. Sarah
        notices and giggles.
        <br /><br />
        Just then, Blaze, Kelly, and Lauren approach. Kelly and Lauren are in
        coveralls. Lauren is wiping her greasy hands with a rag. Blaze’s Benz is
        fixed, earlier than expected. “The parts came faster than we thought,”
        says Lauren.
        <br /><br />
        Kelly adds, “It should be ready later this afternoon.”
        <br /><br />
        Blaze says to Catie that they need to get going if they’re to make it to
        the cabin by tomorrow. Catie hesitates. She doesn’t really want to go.
        “Can’t we spend Christmas here, Blaze?” Blaze is in disbelief. This is
        the last place he wants to spend Christmas. Beryl is also in disbelief.
        He thought he’d have a few days more to spend with Catie, explain how he
        felt. He looks questioningly at Kelly and Lauren while Blaze and Catie
        are arguing. Kelly and Lauren both shrug as if to say the repairs went
        faster than they thought. What were they supposed to do? Sarah comes
        over to investigate what the commotion is all about. Blaze is really
        starting to cause a small scene.
        <br /><br />
        “Fine, Blaze,” says Catie abruptly, stopping the argument. “Head back to
        the Bed and Breakfast and start packing. I’ll be right behind.” Blaze
        turns around and leaves with Kelly and Lauren.
        <br /><br />
        Sarah walks right up to Catie and looks straight up at her. “Does this
        mean you won’t spend Christmas in Turnberry?” asks Sarah with a
        quivering lip.
        <br /><br />
        Catie kneels down to Sarah’s level and tries to comfort her. “Oh Sarah,”
        she tucks a piece of Sarah’s hair behind her ear. “This week has been so
        special. I don’t think any Christmas could ever compare to this.” She
        gives Sarah a big hug. Sarah is sobbing on Catie’s shoulder. “In fact,
        if you think about it, it was almost like every day this last week was
        Christmas.” Sarah takes her head off Catie’s shoulder and looks her in
        the eye, wiping away tears. Catie continues, “So, in a way, it’s like I
        did spend Christmas in Turnberry.” Neither Catie nor Sarah are buying
        this, though. Catie is trying just as hard to convince herself as she is
        Sarah.
        <br /><br />
        Catie stands up. Not far from her is Trent, polishing some decorations
        in his hand with a soft cloth. He looks at Catie but doesn’t say
        anything. He doesn’t need to. Catie remembers their conversation last
        night, but shrugs him off, burying her feelings.
        <br /><br />
        Catie walks over to Beryl. She stops when she gets to him. She starts to
        go in for a hug, but Beryl sort of slights her by extending his hand for
        a handshake. He’s doing this because he’s both upset to see her actually
        leaving with Blaze, and also to protect his own feelings. “Catie,
        I...I…” He knows what he wants to say, but can’t say it. “Thanks again
        for last night. The hay, I mean.”
        <br /><br />
        Catie looks a little disappointed. “You’re welcome. Merry Christmas.”
        They say goodbye, but clearly they both leave a lot that needs to be
        said. Catie walks out of the rink. Blaze can be seen walking ahead with
        Kelly and Lauren toward the shop down a ways on Main Street. Catie turns
        around again to get one last good look at Beryl. She starts walking
        away.
        <br /><br />
        After walking a couple of yards, Beryl shouts to her, “Catie, wait!” He
        runs halfway to her as she turns around with a hopeful look in her eye.
        “I...I…,” stutters Beryl. He can’t bring himself to say what he’s
        thinking. “Watch out for that first bend outside of town. It can really
        surprise you.”
        <br /><br />
        “Thanks,” says Catie through the tears welling up in her eyes. Beryl’s
        half smile has turned into a half-frown. Catie turns around again and
        continues walking. Beryl doesn’t move. He just watches Catie walk out of
        the rink and his life. The rest of the town resumes decorating for that
        night’s performance.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Cut to the skating rink. Night. The skating rink is fully decorated. The
        Christmas lights shine through the cold night.
        <br /><br />
        Later that night, the whole town congregates at the skating rink to
        watch the nativity. But there’s a little less magic with Catie gone (the
        whole town misses her). There’s an area on the ice designated as the
        stage, although it’s not elevated. In front of it, rows of chairs have
        been set up for the town to sit in. A curtain has been hung across some
        rope to hide the scenery from the audience. Off to the side of the
        congregation is a brass band setting up to provide music for the night.
        We see Cassandra blowing air through her trumpet.
        <br /><br />
        Beryl and Erin sit in the audience and wait for the show to start, but
        there’s clearly some delay. The show isn’t starting. Madi approaches
        Erin and Beryl. She explains that they’re having problems convincing the
        Christmas Angel (Sarah) to go on with the show. Erin starts to get up to
        walk with Madi backstage to talk to Sarah. Beryl also starts to get up.
        “I’ve got this.” He motions for Erin to set back down. “Let me talk to
        her.” Erin gives him the go-ahead.
        <br /><br />
        Beryl and Madi walk backstage and find Sarah with a tear-streaked face
        and red eyes. She’s still wiping tears away with the back of her hand.
        Her lips are quivering. Sarah can barely go on, she’s almost sobbing
        with Catie gone. Beryl kneels down to be at her level. “What’s wrong,
        Angel?” He asks.
        <br /><br />
        “I miss Catie. I want her to come and see me be the angel and tell
        everyone about the baby Jesus!”
        <br /><br />
        “There were some things I wanted her to hear me say, too.” Beryl says.
        He hugs Sarah. Sarah sobs on Beryl’s shoulders. Beryl acknowledges that
        Catie was pretty great, and that the whole town misses her. But he
        explains there’s nothing they can really do about that right now. He
        says that it’s going to be Christmas soon, and Sarah needs to do her
        part. “I bet, wherever Catie is right now, she’ll be thinking about you
        when you tell everyone about the baby Jesus.” He’s trying to convince
        himself that she’ll be thinking about him, as he knows he’ll be thinking
        about her.
        <br /><br />
        “I loved her, Uncle Beryl!” Sarah sobs.
        <br /><br />
        Beryl chuckles, “Oh, Angel. That makes two of us.” Beryl pulls Sarah
        into his arms and gives her a big hug. He realizes that he should have
        told Catie how he felt.
        <br /><br />
        Sarah sobs on Beryl’s shoulders while they’re still hugging. Beryl talks
        Sarah into “doing it for Catie.” He wipes away her tears. Sarah has a
        smile on her face. “So whaddya say, Angel? Think you can get out there
        and be the best angel Christmas has ever seen?” Sarah nods, wiping away
        tears.
        <br /><br />
        Beryl sends Sarah on her way and walks back to his seat next to Erin.
        Erin looks at Beryl with a look that says “Well? Is everything okay?”
        Beryl nods and winks at Erin and gives the thumbs up. “Sarah’s going to
        be fine.” He starts to sit down
        <br /><br />
        “Are you?” questions Erin with raised eyebrows.
        <br /><br />
        Before he can sit down, Beryl thinks for a minute and says, “There’s
        something I gotta go do. Save my seat?” Erin nods with a big smile.
        Beryl squeezes between the seats in the next row and people’s legs in
        his row. “Excuse me. Sorry folks. Pardon me. Glad you all could make it.
        Sorry about this.” Finally he makes it out of the row and briskly walks
        to the skating rink’s exit. He almost runs into Kelly and Lauren.
        They’re no longer dressed in their coveralls. They’ve put on nice
        clothes for the show.
        <br /><br />
        “Oh good,” says Beryl with relief. “Is Catie still at the garage?”
        <br /><br />
        “No,” says Kelly with a confused look on his face. Then a thought comes
        to him. “But, they did mention that they still need to pack a few things
        at the Bed and Breakfast.” Before Kelly can finish, Beryl sprints down
        Main Street toward the Bed and Breakfast.
        <br /><br />
        The rink lights go low except for two spotlights that show Madi taking
        center stage. Madi thanks all those who helped. She says something funny
        and the crowd chuckles. She introduces the show. The curtains are pulled
        back revealing a beautifully decorated skating rink that now more
        closely resembles an ancient Bethlehem and countryside with ice instead
        of dirt for ground. Scattered “Ooh” and “Ahhh” emanate from the crowd.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Cut back to Beryl running down mainstreet. Buildings and Christmas
        lights speeding past in a blur.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Cut back to the Nativity. We see the audience’s point of view. On the
        makeshift “stage” on the ice we see a young boy and girl playing Joseph
        and Mary. We hear the narrator say, “And Joseph also went up from
        Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judæa, unto the city of
        David, which is called Bethlehem.” The boy and girl skate through the
        Bethlehem scenery.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Cut to the Bed and Breakfast. Beryl runs up to the front door and opens
        it. The lights inside are still on. He bursts through the doorway
        shouting, “Catie! Catie!” He’s got a big smile on his face. He can’t
        wait to see her again and tell her how he feels. But the main floor is
        completely deserted. He runs through the dining room, the sitting room.
        “Catie!” Nothing.
        <br /><br />
        He sees the lights on upstairs. He races up the stairs two at a time.
        “Catie!” He runs into Catie’s and Blaze’s room. “Catie.” He shouts the
        first syllable, but not the second, as he runs into the room. He comes
        to sudden halt. The room is empty. The beds are neatly made. The closets
        are empty. There’s no sign of them anywhere. All that’s left is Catie’s
        blue scarf on the bed. He sits on the bed and holds the scarf in defeat.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Cut back to the Nativity on Ice. We see from above, Mary wrapping a baby
        in swaddling clothes and placing him in a manger while Joseph and fake
        animals look on. The brass band starts to play “Silent Night.”
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Cut to Erin’s point of view. Beryl’s empty seat is next to her.
        Offscreen we hear Beryl approaching, again squeezing between the other
        patrons’ legs. He gets to his seat and sits down.
        <br /><br />
        “How’s it coming?” Beryl asks.
        <br /><br />
        “Good, you’re just in time for the Angel.”
        <br /><br />
        We see a myriad of grown ups and children in ornate bath robes with
        shepherd crooks skating around the Bethlehem countryside. They’re
        skating around fake sheep standing on the ice.
        <br /><br />
        The narrator explains, “And there were in the same country shepherds
        abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo,
        the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone
        round about them: and they were sore afraid.”
        <br /><br />
        Sarah skates in circles around the shepherds and their flocks. Raising
        her hands, she says, stumbling over her hard-to-remember lines, “Fear
        not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be
        to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a
        Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.”
        <br /><br />
        She stops skating in circles and goes to the front of the shepherds.
        “And this shall be a sign unto you;” she pauses, trying to remember what
        comes next. The whole town is watching and she’s very nervous. “Ye shall
        find...Ye shall find…” She bites her lip. The audience is starting to
        fidget in nervousness on her behalf. Sarah tries again. “And this shall
        be a sign unto you; ye shall find...ye shall find…” She pauses, trying
        to remember. The silence hangs heavy in the air. Sarah looks nervously
        to the audience.
        <br /><br />
        She tries again. “Ye shall find…” Her eyes get really big. A smile
        stretches across her face as she sees someone in the very back of the
        audience. “Ye shall find CATIE!”
        <br /><br />
        The whole audience/town gasps. They look to see Catie walking into the
        rink. Even the spotlights swirl around to shine on Catie in the back of
        the rink. She shields her eyes from the bright spotlights. The town
        begins to chatter with excitement at Catie’s return. Catie is a little
        embarrassed at all the attention. The audience stands up in their chairs
        and begin to walk toward her. The first ones to greet her are Emma,
        Brock, Chella, Dallan, Esther, Derek, Trent, Jenn. They take turns
        giving her a hug. Even Beryl and Erin move toward Catie, but Beryl hangs
        back, cautious to get too excited. Catie, however, walks straight toward
        Beryl. The crowd starts to part. They know where she’s headed. But Sarah
        intercepts, almost knocking Catie over. She gives Catie’s waist the
        biggest hug. “Catie!” Sarah squeals. Catie chuckles then lifts up Sarah
        into her arms.
        <br /><br />
        Erin comes to get Sarah off Catie. “Come here my little angel.”
        <br /><br />
        Catie hands Sarah over and gives Erin a sisterly hug. There’s still a
        low hum of people chattering over the return of Catie.
        <br /><br />
        Catie briskly walks up to Beryl. She stops in front of him like she has
        before. But this time she surprises him by wrapping her arms around him.
        Beryl is a little taken aback, but happy. They embrace. The whole town
        forms an impromptu circle around the two.
        <br /><br />
        “What made you come back?” Asks Beryl, still holding her tight, but
        looking intently into her eyes.
        <br /><br />
        She looks around at the crowd. She eyes Trent, who has a big smile on
        his face. She says, “I decided it was finally time to follow my
        heartpeanut.” Trent’s smile gets bigger and he squeezes Jenn closer. “I
        just couldn’t imagine Christmas anywhere else. With anyone else.” The
        crowd cheers and congratulates each other. The married couples hold each
        other close, some kiss. Children dressed in homemade ancient Hebrew
        costumes join their families.
        <br /><br />
        Not far in the distance the clock tower strikes twelve, heralding in the
        Holiday of Holidays. Snow begins to fall from the sky as if signaled by
        the bells. The crowd begins to exclaim “Oh,” in excitement. The band
        begins to play Hark the Herald Angels Sing at a quick tempo (not slow
        like it’s always played in church). The crowd cheers. Couples and
        families embrace one another and begin singing along at the top of their
        lungs. It’s Christmas!
        <br /><br />
        Beryl and Catie stare into each other’s eyes, each with a big grin and
        snow flakes in their hair and on their face. They kiss. The crowd sees
        this and cheers even wilder. It resembles New Year’s Eve more than
        Christmas morning. They break the kiss. Catie asks, with a smile
        (knowing the answer), “What are you so happy about?”
        <br /><br />
        To which Beryl responds, “It just feels like...It feels like Christmas
        morning.”
        <br /><br />
        Catie chuckles. “It is Christmas morning, silly.”
        <br /><br />
        Beryl smiles big. “Oh I know. I know. It is Christmas morning.”
        <br /><br />
